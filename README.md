# goodreads_visualizations

I am a huge reader. Combine that with my love of data and organization, and you get a robust GoodReads profile. I have tracked nearly every book I have read for the past 4 years, including my rating and the date I read each book. I downloaded my personal data from goodreads.com in the form of a CSV, then I made some fun visualizations to explore my reading habits with Seaborn.

In this Jupyter Notebook, I answer the following questions with Visualizations:
* How many books did I read each year?
* Is there any particular trend in the number of books I read per year? Am I reading increasingly more?
* How do my ratings compare to "average" ratings?
* How many books do I read of each size? Do I read shorter or longer books, usually?
* Do I tend to read more or less during certain months?
