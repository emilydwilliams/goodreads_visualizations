# goodreads_visualizations

I am a huge reader. Combine that with my love of data and organization, and you get a robust GoodReads profile. I have tracked nearly every book I have read for the past 4 years, including my rating and the date I read each book. I downloaded my personal data from goodreads.com in the form of a CSV, then I made some fun visualizations to explore my reading habits with Seaborn.
